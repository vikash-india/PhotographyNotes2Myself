# Description: Photoshop Tips

### Tips
* **Reset Workspace:** Hold Ctrl + Alt + Shift while opening Photoshop CS6 to reset the workspace to default.
* **Change Workspace Theme:** Click Menu - File - Preference - Interface - Choose a theme.
* **Animation and Motion Graphics:** Click Menu - Window - Workspace - Motion.
* **Close Everything** Close all open images at once by holding down the Shift key and clicking the close icon on any 
    one of the image windows.

### Install fonts ONLY for Photoshop CS6
* Install fonts ONLY for Photoshop CS6 without installing those fonts as a system wide Windows font by copying the TTF
  files to the location `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts`.
* Photoshop will take time to load these fonts. So install only what is required.
* Google Fonts is a good place to verify fonts.
