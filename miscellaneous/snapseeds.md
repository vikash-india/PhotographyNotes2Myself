### Tune Image
* Brightness: Darken or brighten the entire image.
* Contrast: Increase or decrease the difference between the dark and bright areas.
* Saturation: Make the colors more or less vibrant.
* Ambiance: Adjust color saturation and contrast at the same time.
* Shadows: Darken or lighten only the shadows (dark areas) in your image.
* Highlights: Darken or lighten only the highlights (bright areas) in your photo.
* Warmth: Add a warm orange or cool blue color cast to your image.

### White Balance
* Temperature: Make the colors in your photo cooler (more blue) or warmer (more orange).
* Tint: Add a green or pink color tint to your image.

### Details
* Structure produces better results in most cases. 
* The Sharpening tool often reduces the quality of your image by introducing grain. If you do use Sharpening, use it in 
  moderation.
  
### Healing
* Use this to remove unwanted objects.
* It’s perfect for removing small objects, spots, and blemishes. You’ll get the best results when the object you want to 
  remove is surrounded by plain detail, such as skin, sky or sea.
  
### Portrait
* Select a preset beneath your image to begin with. Eg. Spotlight 1, Smooth 1, etc. 
* Swipe up or down to access the Portrait tools - Face Spotlight, Skin Smoothing, and Eye Clarity. 
* Face Spotlight: Brighten your subject’s face, while making their surroundings slightly darker.
* Skin Smoothing: Make your subject’s skin appear smooth and flawless.
* Eye Clarity: Make your subject’s eyes sparkle.

### Brush
* The Brush tool gives you ultimate control over selectively adjusting brightness and color. It’s perfect for photos 
  where different parts of the scene need brightening or darkening.
* Dodge & Burn brush to brighten or darken certain areas of your photo. Tap the up or down arrows to adjust the tool’s 
  value.
* Saturation brush at +5 to make the orange colors slightly more vibrant.

### Selective
* The Selective Tool lets you edit different colors in your photo individually.

### Masking
* Masking allows you to apply any Snapseed edit selectively.

### Change The Mood With Snapseed Filters
