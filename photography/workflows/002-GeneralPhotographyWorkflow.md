### Photography Philosophy
* Mantras
    - ​Sharpness Sharpness and Sharpness!!
    - Composition Composition and Composition!!
    - Focus Focus and Focus!!
    - Working a Scene: Spend maximum time on working the scene rather than reviewing images.
* Photography Philosophy
    - Think creatively.
    - Practice everyday.
    - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
        * Minimalist
        * Enough of negative/empty spaces
    - Use photography vocabulary.
    - RTFM: Read the f***ing manual.
    - Keep the best pics for sharing and discard everything.

### Camera Gears
* Use MyGearVault app to select appropriate camera gears.
* Use Travel Planner to select appropriate camera gears.
* Props
    - Choose appropriate photography props.

### Camera Settings
* Nikon D850
    - Format card(s).
    - Reset camera settings.
    - Set quality image to largest FINE* size image.
    - (If needed) Set image types to RAW+JPG.
    - Set to continuous or burst mode.
    - Set white balance.
    - (If needed) Set bracketing.
    - (If needed) Set HDR.
    - (If needed) Use self timer to remove shakes.
* Nikon D7200
    - Same as above.
* Nikon D90
    - Same as above.

### Photography Workflow
* Start with Auto exposure mode to break out of pattern.

### Postprocessing Workflow
It's best to shoot in RAW but the following workflow will minimise the data loss for JPEGs.
1. **Convert from RAW**
    - Convert from RAW to recover highlights.
2. **Framing**
    - Straighten: Straighten out the scene, level the horizon etc.
    - Crop: Crop to the rule of two-thirds, golden ratio or to remove clutter etc.
3. **Color Corrections**
    - Adjust the white balance, color cast, color temperature etc.
4. **Exposure**
    - Adjust exposure using Levels/Curves.
5. **Contrast**
    - Adjust the contrast using Levels/Curves.
6. **Saturation/Vibrance/Other Color Corrections**
    - Most photos could use a slight boost in saturation, vibrance, etc. to set the mood in a photograph. 
    - These adjustments are often overdone, and frequently aren’t even necessary if white balance, exposure and contrast 
      have been set properly.
    - *Saturation:* Saturation adjusts the intensity of all colors in your image, regardless of the starting point of 
      the colors. Bump it up slightly and you get deeper, richer colors across the board.
    - *Vibrance:* Vibrance on the other hand, only adjusts the intensity of the more muted colors in a photo, and leaves 
      the already well-saturated colors alone.
7. **Detail or Local Sharpening**
    - Sharpening, in particular, can cause a jpeg to lose data, it should never be done sooner.
    - This step is only for detail and localized sharpening, not for overall photo sharpening,
8. **Noise Reduction**
    - Noise Reduction follows sharpening, because sharpening will often add more noise to a photo.
    - Shooting in low light situations and/or with high ISO’s will also add noise to a photo.
9. **Lens Correction**
    - Depending upon the lens and the setting being used for shooting, a photo may have some level of distortion, 
      vignetting, and/or chromatic aberrations.
    - The lens corrections don’t always look better, especially if you’re using a wide angle lens and/or are intending a
      certain effect.
10. **Final Framing**
    - Rotate 
    - Crop
11. **Refinements or Selective Enhancements**
    - This includes spot removal, shadow/highlight adjustment, filters, etc. 
    - Make sure to work on a layer copy instead of the original photo.
12. **Final Sharpening**
    - Once the enhancements are done, do a final sharpening if needed. 
    - Reverse these last two steps if, for some reason, you’ll be making your image larger.
13. **Resizing**
    - Enlarge for a print or downsize for the web or email. 
    - Edit on the largest size possible to work with all the color information that a RAW image offers and resize at the 
      last step.
