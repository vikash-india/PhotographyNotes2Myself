### Method 1: Using Curve Adjustment Layer
* Read about [Understanding Curves](../photoshop_concepts/P004-UnderstandingCurves.md).
* Click Panel - Layer Panel - New Adjustment Layer - Curves.
    * Contrast is to make light area lighter and dark areas darker.
    * Click on the middle of the curve line to set the mid tone or grey point. The area on the right of mid tone point 
      is for the range midtone-to-highlights-to-white and the point on the left of the midtone points is for the range 
      midtone-to-shadows-to-black.
    * Click on the middle of the upper half to set the high tone. Now drag the high tone point above the curve line to 
      make the mid-tone to white area lighter. 
    * Click on the middle of the lower half to set the low tones or shadows. Now drag the low tone point below the curve 
      line to make the mid-tone to black area darker.
