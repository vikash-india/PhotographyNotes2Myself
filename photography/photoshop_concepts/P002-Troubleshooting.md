### Install fonts ONLY for Photoshop CS6
* Install fonts ONLY for Photoshop CS6 without installing those fonts as a system wide Windows font by copying the TTF
  files to the location `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\Fonts`.
* Photoshop will take time to load these fonts. So install only what is required.
* Google Fonts is a good place to verify fonts.
